# 👋 Hi there
My name is Fengxu Liu. I am currently a master’s student at the National University of Singapore.I am currently working with [Dr. Yihan Du](https://yihandu.github.io/) on reinforcement learning research.My research interest includes Machine Learning , Deep learning , Reinforcement learning , Muti-armed bandits.I aspire to pursue a PhD focusing on these directions.For my PhD, I aim to develop principled algorithms with theoretical guarantees and practical impact.

I graduated from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics with a bachelor’s degree and from the School of Statistics and Data Science.

At my personal page, I will share the process of working on some interesting open-source projects on GitHub. I will also post my original content, covering insights from my personal learning and research, hoping to exchange ideas and grow together with everyone!
